          I live in Florida and work in a barbershop. Even though I love my
          current job, I decided to start my journey of becoming my better self
          and began studying coding.

          After my first assignment I understood just how interesting I find it,
          and now I spend almost all of my free time learning new skills and
          applying fresh knowledge to solve challenges.

          Finally, I like to spend the rest of my free time creating Amigurumies
          for my Etsy store (Gianthearts), petting my cat, and of course,
          enjoying the year-round summer!
